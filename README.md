# Tic tac toe game 

## Game Rules
Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to align three of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.

### Symbols
- **Players can choose their symbol**: Players are prompted to choose whether they want to be **X** or **O** at the start of the game.

### Winning Conditions
- A player wins if they manage to align three of their symbols in any of the following ways:
  1. **Horizontally**: All three squares in a single row.
  2. **Vertically**: All three squares in a single column.
  3. **Diagonally**: All three squares in either diagonal.
  
If all 9 squares are filled without any player achieving alignment, the game ends in a **tie**.

## How to Play
1. **Starting the Game**:
- You will be prompted to enter your name and choose whether you want to be **X** or **O**.

2. **Single Player Modes**:
   - You can choose to play against:
     - A **dumb computer** that makes random moves.
     - An **intelligent computer** that blocks potential winning moves and tries to win.

3. **Making a Move**:
   - The game displays the 3x3 board with empty squares.
   - Enter the **row** and **column** numbers (0, 1, or 2) to place your symbol in the desired square.
   - Example: Entering **1** for the row and **2** for the column places your symbol in the middle-right square.

4. **Taking Turns**:
   - Players alternate turns until one player wins or the board is full.
   - If youâ€™re playing against the computer, it will make its move automatically after you make yours.

5. **Ending the Game**:
   - The game ends when one player aligns three symbols or the board is completely filled (tie).
   - The scoreboard is updated to reflect the outcome (win, lose, or tie).
   - You can choose to play another round or exit.

## Tips
- Choose your symbol wisely! Sometimes, picking the second turn can offer strategic advantages.
- Try to occupy the center square whenever possible; it increases your chances of winning.
- Block your opponent's potential winning moves whenever you spot them.

Enjoy the game and have fun!
